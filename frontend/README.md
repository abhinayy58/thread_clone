# Thread Clone

This project is a minimal setup for creating a thread clone using React and Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience and ESLint for code quality.

## Features

- **React with Vite**: A fast and minimal build setup for React projects.
- **HMR Support**: Instant feedback during development using Fast Refresh.
- **ESLint**: Enforced code style and quality rules.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thread-clone.git
   cd thread-clone

2. **Install dependencies:**

   npm install

3. **Start the development server:**

   npm run dev

  The application will be available at <http://localhost:5173>.

Available Scripts

- npm run dev: Starts the development server with HMR.
- npm run build: Builds the application for production.
- npm run preview: Previews the production build locally.
- npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.

Plugins
